# Top 4 formats of datasets:
 1. **Comma-Separated Values(CSV):**
       - CSV files are structured as simple, flat-tabular format where each line corresponds to a row and values are separated by commas.
       - They are commonly used for simple datasets, data import/export in spreadsheets and databases.
 2. **Resource Description Framework(RDF):**
       - RDF files are structred as a framework for representing information in a graph format, consists of triples (subject, predicate, object).
       - This format is useful in metadata management, data integration, and semantic web applications.
 4. **JavaScript Object Notation(JSON):**
       - JSON files are structured as a lightweight data-interchange format, which is easy for humans to read and write, and for machines to parse and generate.
       - They are commonly used in web applications for data transmission between client and server, configuration files, and data storage.
 7. **eXtensible Markup Language(XML):**
       - XML files are strcutured as a Markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
       - They are commonly used in web services, document storage, and configuration.

| Type | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|----------|----------|
| CSV | Lightweight, easy to understand, and readable by many programming languages and applications | Limited to flat, tabular structures; lacks in-built type support and metadata |
| RDF | Supports rich data modeling, semantic annotations, and can link distributed data across different systems. | Higher learning curve, more complex, and larger file sizes compared to CSV. |
| JSON| Readable, flexible structure, supports hierarchical and complex structures. | Less efficient than binary formats, can be more verbose than CSV. |
| XML | Supports complex, hierarchical data structures with the ability to include metadata. | Verbose, which can lead to larger file sizes; parsing can be slow, and the format is more complex compared to JSON and CSV. |


**NOTE:** There are many other formats of datasets, we are discussing about the top common formats which can be found in the about datasets.

**Progress for project:**
**Datasets can be retrived from:**  
https://www.data.gov/  
https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/

**API's:**  
Twitter API for real-time social media data.  
Google Maps API for real-time traffic data.  
Alpha Vantage API or Yahoo Finance API for real-time financial data.  

**Some government and organizational portals provide real-time or near real-time data. For example:**  
USGS Earthquake Data provides real-time earthquake data.  
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provides near real-time data on disease outbreaks including COVID-19.
