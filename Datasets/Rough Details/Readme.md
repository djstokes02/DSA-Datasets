Next meeting points to discuss:
- Some variable descriptions are not provided, so researched on that and described them.
- So now there is covid dataset, i have the script to download it but to run the script continously to upload it to github, we have to upload the script in the AWS and should pay for it.
- Can I work more on this covid dataset, like creating seperate csv files based on country and different different 
- Linkedin Post about the github




**Guidelines for project:**
**Datasets can be retrived from:**  
https://www.data.gov/  
https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/

**API's:**  
Twitter API for real-time social media data.  
Google Maps API for real-time traffic data.  
Alpha Vantage API or Yahoo Finance API for real-time financial data.  

**Some government and organizational portals provide real-time or near real-time data. For example:**  
USGS Earthquake Data provides real-time earthquake data.  
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provides near real-time data on disease outbreaks including COVID-19.
